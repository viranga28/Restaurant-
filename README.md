# Simple Restaurant Management 

A more complete example of a restaurant management system, simulating both frontend and backend functionality.

## Features

*   Displays a menu of items (from simulated backend).
*   Allows users to add items to an order.
*   Calculates the total order price.
*   Simulates submitting an order to the backend.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in your browser

## Git Setup:

(Same as before)

## Further Development (Moving to a real backend):

To create a truly functional system, you would need to:

*   **Replace the simulated backend:** Implement a real backend using Node.js, Python, PHP, or another server-side technology.
*   **Use a Database:** Use a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store persistent data (menu items, orders, users, etc.).
*   **Create API endpoints:** Create API endpoints on your backend to handle requests from the frontend (e.g., getting menu items, submitting orders).
*   **Use fetch or Axios:** Use the `fetch` API or a library like Axios in your frontend code to make requests to your backend API.

This example provides a better understanding of how the frontend and backend would interact in a real application.
